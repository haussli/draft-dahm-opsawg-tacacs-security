- discussion about AVP concatenation, delimiters, and other rules from various
  PRs and emails.  Following Douglas' note about the cmd-arg AVP and the
  discussion about rules for other AVPs, including implementation-specific AVPs,
  it was concluded that we should not attempt to specify generic rules; each
  AVP must define their own rules.

  We also discuss things that are in fact generic; such as maintaining order.
  I have to ask Douglas/Thorsten to comment, because I've forgotten what we
  decided about this.

  There was also discussion about PR #24; Douglas will review the _REPL
  behavior in code and comment on the PR.

  Heasley will wait for these actions before updating S5 of the draft as
  appropriate.

- discussion about PR #18; we will add subsystem info as noted in PR.
